# TradeTrack POS

This is a simple POS (Point of Sale) software for retail/wholesale stores developed in Java JavaFX. The Purchase, Sale, and Inventory modules are completed, and the Finance module may be developed later once time permits. I am also looking for a Java open-source contributor who can help us develop a complete accounting and finance ERP product.
